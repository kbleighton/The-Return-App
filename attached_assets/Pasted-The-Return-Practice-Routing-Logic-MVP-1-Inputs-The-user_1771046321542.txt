The Return — Practice Routing Logic (MVP)
1. Inputs
The user completes a check-in using 4 sliders.
The UI presents 5 positions per slider.
 Internally each position maps to a numeric value:
UI Position
Internal Value
Far Left
0
Left
25
Middle
50
Right
75
Far Right
100

Slider meanings
Slider
Left
Right
Variable Name
Grounded ↔ Scattered
Grounded
Scattered
scattered
Calm ↔ Anxious
Calm
Anxious
anxious
Present ↔ In my head
Present
In my head
inHead
Energized ↔ Exhausted
Energized
Exhausted
exhausted

Higher numbers always indicate greater dysregulation on that axis.

2. Practice Types (Outputs)
The routing engine selects one of four practice categories:
Calm → reduce nervous system activation (slow mind & body)


Ground → shift awareness from thinking into body


Activate → restore energy and engagement


Deep Rest → parasympathetic downshift (tired but wired)



3. Overrides (evaluated first)
These ensure obvious states are handled correctly before scoring.
Override A — High Anxiety
If:
 anxious ≥ 75
→ Serve CALM
(When strongly anxious, always down-regulate first.)

Override B — Tired but Wired (Deep Rest)
If:
 exhausted ≥ 75 AND anxious ≤ 60
→ Serve DEEP REST
(This captures morning exhaustion and late-night wired fatigue.)

Override C — Strong Rumination
If:
 inHead ≥ 80 AND anxious ≤ 65
→ Serve GROUND
(Rumination responds better to body awareness than calming.)

4. Scoring (used if no override triggered)
Each category receives a weighted score.
Calm Score
Best for mental over-activation.
calm = 0.50*anxious
     + 0.25*scattered
     + 0.15*inHead
     + 0.10*exhausted


Ground Score
Best for rumination and cognitive looping.
ground = 0.55*inHead
       + 0.25*scattered
       + 0.10*anxious
       + 0.10*exhausted


Activate Score
Best for low energy, stuckness, disengagement.
 (We reward exhaustion and low anxiety.)
activate = 0.70*exhausted
         + 0.20*scattered
         - 0.30*anxious
         + 0.10*(100 - inHead)


Deep Rest Score
Best for exhausted but not highly anxious states.
deepRest = 0.75*exhausted
         + 0.25*(100 - anxious)


5. Final Selection
If no override was triggered:
Select the practice category with the highest score.
Serve the corresponding guided audio.

6. AI Layer (Important)
The AI does not choose the practice.
The routing engine selects the category.
The AI’s role is only to:
 • acknowledge the state
 • explain the recommendation
 • guide the user into the practice in Kyle’s tone
Example:
“Your mind is still active while your body is tired.
 Instead of pushing forward, let’s help your system fully downshift for a few minutes.”


We add a “Guidance Screen” (2–3 seconds before audio)
After routing selects Calm / Ground / Activate / Deep Rest, the user sees a short message before the audio starts.
Not a paragraph.
Two sentences max.
This is the moment the app feels attuned.

Example outputs (copy/paste spec)
If CALM was selected
Your mind looks active and your body hasn’t settled yet.
 Let’s slow things down together for a few minutes.

If GROUND was selected
You’ve been in your head for a while.
 We’ll bring your attention back into your body.

If ACTIVATE was selected
Your system seems low on energy right now.
 Instead of pushing through, let’s wake it up gently.

If DEEP REST was selected
Your body is tired but your system hasn’t fully downshifted.
 Let’s allow it to truly rest.
(Then: audio automatically begins.)
