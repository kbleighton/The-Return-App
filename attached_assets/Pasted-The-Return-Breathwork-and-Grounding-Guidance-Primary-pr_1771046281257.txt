The Return - Breathwork and Grounding Guidance

Primary promise (functional):
Calm your mind and body in under 5 minutes.
Secondary meaning (identity):
Come back to yourself — and move with intention.


First Launch (one time only)
Launch / Splash screen (2–3 seconds)
This is not a loading screen.
This is a nervous-system cue.
Keep it extremely simple:
dark forest green background


root/trunk icon


text:


The Return
and underneath in small type:
Calm your mind and body in under 5 minutes.
No buttons.
No movement except a subtle fade.
Why it matters:
You are already conditioning regulation before they even interact.

Welcome Screen
Title
Welcome to The Return
Body text
At the end of the day, your body arrives home before your mind does.
Most of us move straight from the noise of the day into distraction — scrolling, thinking, or staying tense without realizing it.
The Return is a simple daily check-in you can use when you get home, before bed, or anytime you want to pause and orient yourself.
In just a few minutes, you can calm your mind and body — and move into the next part of your day with intention instead of momentum.

Button

Screen 5 — First Check-In (the real start of the app)
This is the most important interaction in the entire product.
Title
How are you arriving right now?
(Important: not “How are you feeling?” — that causes overthinking and emotional analysis.)
Sliders
Grounded ↔ Scattered
Calm ↔ Anxious
Present ↔ In my head
Open ↔ Heavy
Button:
Let’s begin
After they press it → the app immediately recommends a 3–4 minute practice.
No menus.
No library browsing.
Immediate guidance.

POST-PRACTICE FLOW (COPY/PASTE)
Screen PP-1 — Integration Pause
Title:
Take a moment.
Body text:
Before moving on, notice what feels different right now.
No need to analyze it.
Just take one breath and observe.
(3–5 second delay before options appear)

Screen PP-2 — State Recognition
Question:
How do you feel now?
Options (single select):
Grounded


Clear


About the same


Still tense


(User must select one to continue)

The Return — Home Screen (MVP Layout)
There is only one primary function.
What the user sees every time they open the app
Top (very minimal)
small tree/root icon


“The Return”


optional subtle line:

 Powered by Embodied Brotherhood


(no menus, no profile picture, no notifications bell)

Center (the actual Home screen)
Large text:
How are you arriving right now?
Underneath:
Take a second. There’s nothing to solve — just notice.
Then the sliders.

The Check-In (this IS the home screen)
Use 4 sliders exactly:
• Grounded ↔ Scattered
• Calm ↔ Anxious
• Present ↔ In my head
• Energized ↔ Exhausted

Primary Button
Large centered button:
Let’s begin
When tapped → the app selects the appropriate practice automatically.
The user does NOT choose a session.
After the practice
They go through the post-practice flow we wrote:
notice → state recognition → intentional next action → return to home.
Now the Home screen has meaning.
It’s no longer a menu.
It’s a doorway.
Where the other features go
You can have a very small bottom tab bar (later, not required for first test):
Check-In (default)


Practices (manual library)


Journal


But even then:
the app should always open back into Check-In.
Because the behavior you are installing is:
“when I need to reset or engage, I open this and it guides me.”
